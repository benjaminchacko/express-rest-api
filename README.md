## Project Description

This repository is an Express.js API routes app which is a simple example of how to use the [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) framework.

I have used the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database to store the data.

I have added API routes to perform CRUD operations on Users and Posts.

Please note that this is a work in progress and is not yet complete.

Todo:

- Add Authentication Routes
- Add Nested Routes for comments to Posts model
